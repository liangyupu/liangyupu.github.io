Yupu Liang is a **Ph.D.** student in [Chinese Information Processing Group](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/staff.htm) (CIP), Institute of Automation, **Chinese Academy of Sciences**, advised by [Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhouyu) and [Chengqing Zong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zongchengqing) and expect to graduate in June 2026.
Before that, he received his **B.E.** degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at **Beihang University** in 2021.

His research focuses on multimodal large language model, document AI (document QA, understanding, and reasoning), and machine translation.
His research has led to several publications at top AI conferences and journals, including ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, TASLP, and TPAMI.
He is currently serving as a reviewer for top conferences and journals, including ACL, NeurIPS, TASLP, etc.
