I am a **Ph.D.** student in [Chinese Information Processing Group](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/staff.htm) (CIP), Institute of Automation, **Chinese Academy of Sciences**, advised by [Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhouyu) and [Chengqing Zong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zongchengqing) and expect to graduate in June 2026.
Before that, I received my **B.E.** degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at **Beihang University** in 2021.

My research focuses on multimodal large language model, document AI (document QA, understanding, and reasoning), and machine translation.
My research has led to several publications at top AI conferences and journals, including ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, TASLP, and TPAMI.
I am currently serving as a reviewer for top conferences and journals, including ACL, NeurIPS, TASLP, etc.

We are organizing the first ICDAR 2025 Competition on End-to-end Document Image Machine Translation [\[DIMT25@ICDAR\]](https://cip-documentai.github.io/).

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) (a traditional Chinese instrument), badmintonüè∏, runningüèÉüèª, and swimmingüèäüèª.
I am a member of the string section in the student Chinese orchestra of Beihang University and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I also manage a Bilibili account \[[1398Âè∑ÁõëÂê¨Âëò\]](https://space.bilibili.com/161643711/upload/opus) where I share my reviews on anime, movies, and books. Feel free to follow!
